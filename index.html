	<h2 id= "AShortHistory"> A Short History </h2>
	<p> Figure skating is defined by by the Merriam-Webster dictionary as "skating characterized by the performance of various 
	jumps, spins, and dance movements". It began in the mid 1800s, when ice skater Jackson Haines, sometimes called the father
 	of figure skating, started jumping and spinning in his performances. Became popular in the European skating community,but didn't
 	become fanous in North America until many years later. The first figure skating competitions were men only events, and after Madge Syers came second in the World Championships. 
	Then, the first woman's event was held in 1906. Since then, figure skating has eveolved from being a pass-time for upperclassmen to being an Olympic sport that 
	many people, men and women, participate in today. </p>

	<h2 id= "FigureSkatingTerminology"> Figure skating Terminology </h2>
	<p> When watching figure skating competitions on television, such as the Olympics, you may hear some unfamiliar terms referring to a skater's jumps or turns, said by news reporters, or the judges of the competition. 
	There are three major types of spins classified by the International Skating Union: Upright spins, Sit Spins, and Camel spins. Below, explainations of the spins and some examples will be given. </p>


	<h3 id= "UprightSpins"> Upright Spins </h3>  <!--category of spins-->
	<img src= "blman.jpeg" alt= "a skater in the biellman position" height= "250" width="195" class="picture">
	<h4> Arabesque </h4>
	


<p> Arabesque is a term that is also used in some dance forms,such as ballet. This move is when a skater raises their leg behind them at
 almost a 180 degree angle, as displayed in the picture above.This move is also used in camel spins. </p>

<h4> Besti Squat </h4> 

<p> Besti squats, named after Natalia Bestemianova, are where the skater squats down with their legs spread and skates on the outer edges of 
their skates. </p>

<h4> Biellman Spins </h4>  


<p> The name of this spin comes from Denise Biellman. She did not invent it, but she made it popular. Biellman Spins are advanced spins, but very 
popular in competitions. They are done  by pulling on your back leg and raising it straight behind your head, similar to the needle in gymnastics.
There are many variations of thismove,such as the one-handed Biellman, and the Half-Biellman. </p>
<h4>  Shotgun Spins </h4> 

<p> Shotgun spins are upright spins is which your leg that is not on the ground is held straight in front of you. This move is also called a spiral spin. </p> 


<h3 id= "SitSpins"> Sit Spins</h3> <!--another category, that's why its bolder--> 

<img src= "sitt.jpeg" alt= "a skater in a sit spin" height= "250" width="195" class="picture">

<p> Sit spins are a category of spins where the skater appears to be "sitting", with their behind lower than their knee. Above, a skater is shown in a basic sit spin position. </p>

<h4> Basic Sit Spins </h4> 

<p> A basic sit spin is where the skater sits on the leg they usually skate with. The other leg is positioned straight in front of them, their arms are raised either in front of them or straight up, and they skate in a circle. </p>

<h4> Shoot The Duck position </h4> 

<p> The Shoot The Duck position is a variation of the basic sit spin, except the skater glides backwards or forward. </p>
<h4> Broken Leg Sit Spin </h4> 

<p> A broken leg sit spin is the same as a normal sit spin, but the skater has to turn their leg in inwards. </p>

 <h3 id= "CamelSpins"> Camel Spins </h3>

<img src= "cameel.jpeg" alt= "a skater in a camel spin position" height= "250" width="195" class="picture">

<p> Camel Spins are another category of skating spins. Camel spins are where the skater's leg is held behind them, and their knee must be higher 
than their hip. </p>

<h2 id= "FigureSkatingCostumes"> Figure skating costumes </h2>
<img src= "compdress.jpeg" alt= "a blue female figure skating costume" height= "250" width="195" class="picture"> 
<p> The International Skating Union states that costumes must be "modest, dignified and appropriate for athletic competition &minus; not garish or 
theatrical in design." Skaters are allowed to make or buy their own costumes, but they can get points taken off their program if a part of their costume comes off. Also, their program can be stopped if their costume may cause injury. 
In competitions, female skaters get to choose between pants or a dress, and they either wear tights or shorts underneath their dresses, if they choose to wear one. 
However, in competitions such as the Olympics, male skaters are only allowed to wear pants. Above, an image of a figure skating competition dress is shown. </p>


<h2 id= "InjuriesInFigureSkating"> Injuries in Figure Skating </h2> 



<p id="bottom"> Figure skating, just like any sport, can be dangerous if you are ill-prepared. To prevent injury, make sure you are wearing skates that fit you. If you are learning to skate, helmets are highly recommended. 
Common injuries in the skating community include concussions after being dropped in pair skating, slices with skate blades, and bumping into each other during practices. To prevent getting sliced by skates, 
most skaters have skate guards that they put onto their blades when they get off the ice. </p>
